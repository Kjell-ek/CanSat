# CanSat

## Overview  
A low‐cost, student‐built CanSat payload for in-flight environmental monitoring, designed under strict 300 g mass and 550 cm³ volume limits. It records pressure, temperature and air‐quality, accelerometer, compass, ultrasonic distance, PIR, and humidity and streams telemetry to a ground station.

## Mission  
Fly the CanSat along a predefined path over a lake, sand, trees and urban areas to profile environmental variations.

## Features  
- **Compact 3D-printed enclosure** with hinged panels for rapid sensor swaps
- **Embedded firmware** on Arduino Nano using SPI
- **Ground‐station software** (Python) for real-time telemetry plotting and data archiving
